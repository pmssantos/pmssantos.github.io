<b> If you're looking for a work/research opportunity: </b><br>
I'm looking for motivated and curious Ph.D. students to work on Edge Computing and Wireless Communications. 
I have multiple use-cases with companies to motivate and leverage this research.
You'll have the opportunity to work in a work-renown research center and schools (CISTER and University of Porto), and live in a vibrant city with excellent connectivity.
Ask me about the available opportunities, requirements, stipend and timeframe to start your Ph.D.
<br></p>

<p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#1F477D; padding: 1em;">
<b> If you're a company looking for an academic partner: </b><br>
There are a number of funding opportunities, both national and international, that can be leveraged to explore an I&D idea throughout the entire year.
CISTER and FEUP have an extensive track record of successful participation in national and European projects.
Typically, the industrial partner offers a concrete use-case that the academic partner can address with its expertise (typically low-to-medium TRLs).
Ask me how about possible funding sources (they're open all year round).</p>
