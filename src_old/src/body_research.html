<p id ='bodytext'><b>Project Description:</b>Connected vehicles are set to become a pervasive reality in the upcoming years. Despite the emergence of this trend, providing seamless connectivity and computing services to vehicles reveals a challenging task, requiring coordinated work between numerous players and the integration of the respective technologies. FLOYD, a Research & Innovation (R&I) project led by Capgemini Engineering, has the main purpose of building such a technological stack for offering high-performance network/computation services to vehicular users. Through the collaboration between complementary R&I industrial and academic entities, FLOYD will enable the development, validation, and exploitation of a variety of components and technologies, addressing multiple unanswered interrogations between vehicular and network communications.</p>

<p id ='bodytext'><b>Project Description:</b>The standard approach of IoT applications when leveraging cloud infrastructure to address constraints at the level of end and edge nodes is no longer viable, especially for applications with hard real-time requirements and increasing AI usage. This project will develop MIRAI Framework Building Blocks (MFBB) based on AI techniques in order to enable the smart and sustainable planning and operation of IoT and edge computing applications. This will supplement the traditional vertical scaling approach to the cloud with the horizontal scaling of IoT and edge computing applications amongst edge devices.</p>

<p id ='subtitletext'>Research Topics</p>

<p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#1F477D; padding: 1em;">
<b> Wireless Technologies: Development and Experimental Work</b><br></p>	
	<p style="margin-bottom:0.7cm;">Multiple Input and Multiple Output (MIMO) systems are starting to permeate all wireless technologies, from cellular (Massive MIMO) to open IEEE 802.11 standards (Multi-user MIMO). As MIMO setups are often multi-antenna, wireless positioning through Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) detection becomes tightly associated to MIMO technologies. Much of this work is about messing around with Linux-based networking tools, diving into the drivers' source code, or implementing some of the technologies over FPGAs for greater control.<br><br>

	While not being a line-of-work in itself, I believe it is worth mentioning the group's accumulated know-how on experimental methodologies and related equipment for network measurements. 
	We have characterized the performance of vehicle-to-vehicle in multiple contexts. 
	I've done some work in propagation modelling in forest and overwater context. Overall we have a strong theoretical background on propagation models and experience with packet-based RSSI measurements.</p>

<b> Edge/Cloud Architectures, Software Defined Networking & Network Security</b><br></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:0.7cm;">Lately we've been addressing the particular aspect of vehicular service provision by edge nodes through road-side networking infrastructure.
	Software-defined Networking (SDN) is becoming the norm for agile and efficient network management, but the mechanisms to support real-time flows and the overhead it imposes in the Quality of service of such flows is still being evaluated.
	Edge nodes at domestic or industrial installations are prone to attacks from malicious agents. By leveraging machine learning to model traffic profiles, we can detect suspicious behaviour and prevent attacks.</p>

<p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#1F477D; padding: 1em;">
<b> Machine Learning & Data Science</b><br></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:0.7cm;">Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) permeate so much of our current technology that is impossible to steer way from it. We find ML relevant in all work development that is data-driven and in which the data-producing process is complex and hard to model. Hence, we try to keep up with the state-of-the-art in the topic.
	Tightly coupled to the previous topic, data is now being produced abundantly by systems and sensors. Leveraing that data to characterize the behaviour of a system or process is becoming an efficient, and often the only way, to be able to actuate back into that system or process. Needless to say, this approach often pairs with ML mechanisms.</p>
